# Java section

There are some android applications here, for example "ESP12AndroidApplication" that communicates with microcontroller ESP12 by sockets. With this app you can controll the color of RGB diode connected with ESP12 and display data (temperature, pressure and time) from sensors on your smartphone. I tried to make it possible to connect to ESP12 from outside the WiFi but there is a problem with dynamic IP, so for now it can only be used in WiFi network.

In some projects I used Spring and Hibernate, which I`m still learning.
